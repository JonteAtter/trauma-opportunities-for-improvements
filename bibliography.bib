	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} 
        The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma devised process audit filters to identify opportunities for improvement ({OFI}), prevent adverse outcomes, and improve quality. Delay to the operating room for primary trauma laparotomy is a process audit filter that has not been definitively associated with improved outcomes. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of delay to the operating room of greater than 2 hours ({DOR}) to independently identify an adverse outcome or an {OFI} at our Level I trauma center.
        {METHODS} 
        Trauma patients who underwent primary exploratory laparotomy from July 2006 to March 2015 were reviewed. Those with {DOR} were identified and compared with those without {DOR}. To analyze the ability of {DOR} to independently identify an adverse outcome or an {OFI}, {DOR} patients were further divided into those with isolated {DOR} and those with {DOR} in conjunction with one or more other process audit filter. Primary outcome was the presence of a complication. Secondary outcome was an identified {OFI}. Medical records of patients with either outcome were reviewed to determine if the outcome resulted directly from {DOR}.
        {RESULTS} 
        Of 472 patients, 109 (23\%) had {DOR} and 363 (77\%) did not. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or injury severity between the two groups. The rates of complications among {DOR} patients and those without {DOR} were not significantly different (35\% vs. 38\%, p = 0.59). The {DOR} was the only process audit filter flagged in 31(28\%) patients in the {DOR} group. This subgroup had no identified complications but incurred two {OFIs}; neither {OFI} was associated with an adverse outcome.
        {CONCLUSION} 
        In trauma patients undergoing primary exploratory laparotomy, {DOR} fails to independently identify adverse outcomes. These findings suggest that {DOR}, as a routinely collected process audit filter, is not an effective indicator of suboptimal care or adverse outcomes at a Level I trauma center.
