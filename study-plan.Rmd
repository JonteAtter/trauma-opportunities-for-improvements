*Trauma is the most common cause of death among Swedes during the first
four decades of life* [@riddez2013] *Yet a systematic review covering
trauma-related studies in Nordic countries the years 1995--2018, show
that they fall behind when it comes to number of publications on the
subject compared with other economically similar countries.*
[@jeppesen2020] jag vet inte vad jag ska göra

*In the same time, Nordic countries differ from other countries with
colder climate, few cases of serious trauma annually and long distances
to trauma centres as few hospitals are equipped to treat trauma-1
patients.* [@jeppesen2020] *In Sweden, the Karolinska University
hospital covers the regions of Stockholm, Gotland, Södermanland and
Västmanland, equivalent to 3 million residents. This is just on pair
with the minimum number of patients needed to be recognized as a quality
trauma centre internationally. The hospital is also the only facility in
Sweden to qualify as a trauma-1 hospital according to American
standards* [@KarolinskaTraumaCentrum2018]

*From 2010, The Swedish Trauma society holds a national registry over
patients suffering serious trauma in Sweden, where serious trauma is
defined as traumatic events leading to either a trauma alarm or a new
injury severity score (NISS) over 15. In 2021, a total of 10,528
patients (an increase of 17% from 2020) were registered. Of these, 90%
were assigned to blunt traumas such as falls, traffic accidents and
blunt force traumas with objects and the rest to penetrating trauma such
as gun shots and stabbing. [@SweTrau_årsrapport_2021]*

*To detect non-optimal treatment, trauma patients with fatal outcome are
evaluated by a multidisciplinary review board appointed by the hospital.
The group consists of a surgeon, an anaesthetist, a trauma nurse and a
specialist from the relevant specialty, dependent on specific injury
e.g., intracranial, orthopaedical or thoracic/vascular. Competences
involved in the direct care of the patient are free to attend the
conference but should not take part in the review. The aim of the review
is to determine cause of death and whether the outcome was anticipated.
The review should further be used as the basis for identifying
opportunities for improvement (OFI) and following interventions to
prevent avoidable deaths*[@fortydligadeDodsanalys2019] *The Karolinska
University Hospital holds a register of trauma patients treated at the
hospital, were OFI is registered as a binary variable (yes/no) for each
patients registered.*

***Opportunities for improvement OFI***

*Both anticipated (preventable) and unanticipated (non-preventable)
mortality can be presented with-or without opportunities for improvement
(OFI). OFI include all aspects of the medical chain e.g. prehospital
care, under triage, delays, etc where there are opportunities for
optimisation*

***Clinical prediction models***

*Several prediction models (e.g., NEWS) are applied in the clinic to
help health care workers distinguish between seriously injured trauma
patients and stabile ones. For the models to be clinically useful, they
should be user-friendly and guide important decisions in stressful and
time scarce situations, why they often include few parameters and have
binary outcomes. While user-friendly, these generic models lack
precision and are static throughout different settings, making them
difficult to evaluate with respect to patient outcome.* [@baker2017] *To
improve survival for trauma-1 patients, we therefore want to identify
specific opportunities for improvement by studying patient outcomes and
specific opportunities for improvement assessed by the multidisciplinary
review board at the Karolinska University Hospital.*

\*\**Aim* *Identify specific opportunities for improvement related to
blunt multisystem trauma with traumatic brain injury, blunt multisystem
trauma without traumatic brain injury, penetrating trauma, and isolated
severe traumatic brain injury, through assessment of clinical patient
cohorts.*

# Methods

***Study design***

*A registry-based cohort study linking data from the Swedish trauma
registry SweTrau and trauma care quality data base at the Karolinska
University Hospital in Solna. The combined data will further be assessed
through multinominal logistic regression to identify specific
opportunities for improvements (OFI), identified by the
multidisciplinary review board at the Karolinska University Hospital.
All data will be managed and analysed in R software using ...*
